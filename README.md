# PS AdBlock
PowerShell-based AdBlock Script

This script does exactly what you think: It grabs various "hosts" sources from the internet, saves them locally, and merges them to one big file. Enjoy an ad-free Windows experience.

- Download as many "hosts" files as you want
- Merge them automatically into one big "hosts" file
- Remove duplicates from the "hosts" file
- Remove any comment line starting with # to keep your hosts file as small as possible
- Apply a custom whitelist or even custom blacklists
- Log the entire process to a log file (placed within the same directory where you saved this script)
